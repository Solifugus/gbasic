# G-SQL Phase 0a spikes

The storage-engine candidates of `docs/gsql_storage_design.md`, built small enough to measure. **Spike code**:
- nothing here is linked into `gbasic`;
- nothing here is run by `tests/run_all.sh` (§1 of the design says so);
- a written-off candidate is deleted, with its numbers recorded in the design.

The shared pieces they stand on, the I/O layer and the crash harness, are in the tree proper (`src/gsql/`) and gated by `tests/run_gsql_io.sh`.

```sh
research/gsql/run.sh              # build, test and crash-gate every candidate (~35 s per engine)
GATE_SCALE=quick research/gsql/run.sh
```

| `btree.c` | **one** B+tree over slotted pages and a small pager interface, shared by §2.A and §2.B |
| `btengine.c` | above the pager, shared by §2.A and §2.B: the catalog of named trees, a transaction's view of it, records, cursors and cursor invalidation |
| `cow.c` | **§2.A**, the copy-on-write B+tree |
| `wal.c` | **§2.B**, the B+tree with a write-ahead log |

| `crash_store.c` | a candidate under the crash harness |

## Why §2.A and §2.B share one tree

The comparison is meant to measure the engines, not two independently written trees (§3).

- **The pager decides what "write this page" means.** Under copy-on-write, a page not yet written in this transaction moves to a new number and its old one is freed, so every ancestor must follow. Under a write-ahead log, the page keeps its number, so the climb stops as soon as nothing above needs to move.
- **The tree code is otherwise identical.** That includes splits, merges, overflow chains and cursors, and the leaf links that §2.B has and §2.A cannot.

## What building it found, so far

- **A 4 KiB page cannot hold §1.2's 1,024-byte key.** §3.1.3 requires every page to hold four cells. A quarter of a 4 KiB page body, less the slot and the worst leaf cell's overhead (a value in overflow pages), is 984 bytes, so the key limit is the smaller of 1,024 and that. It is 1,024 at 8 KiB.
- **2.A's meta slots are pages 1 and 2, not slots in page 0's root area.** At a 512-byte page, page 0 is one sector, and two slots inside it could not be written independently (rule 3).
- **The header checksum covers only page 0's fixed 76 bytes.** It sits at bytes 76 to 80, the end of the unused key-check block. Each candidate's root area changes after creation, so a checksum over the whole of page 0 would go stale on every commit.
- **2.A's free list is a blob, not a tree.** It is written at each durable commit, as BoltDB does: inline in the meta page when it fits, otherwise a chain of pages taken from the end of the file, so that writing it never consumes the list it is recording.
  - The first version leaked pages on every reopen, and `check` found it. The chain naming the previous list is freed by the new meta, but that was recorded only in memory, never in the list being written.
- **A `sync = false` commit in 2.A writes its pages but no meta page.** The next sync, or the next synced commit, writes one meta covering every commit since (group commit). A page freed by a commit is reusable only once that commit is durable and no open snapshot predates it.
  - Dropping the "is durable" half was caught at 90 violations in 504 crashes. It is what keeps a fall-back to the older meta safe.
- **2.A cannot keep a commit that had not returned durable**, because only a meta page makes a commit recoverable. A crash keeps one only when it hits that meta write itself.
- **Two meta slots matter only when the meta page's live bytes span sectors.** In a light workload the header, the roots and the inline free list fit in the first 512 bytes, the rest of the page is zero in both versions, and any tear yields one valid page or the other. So writing every meta to one slot passed 6,000 torn crashes at 512 B and at 4 KiB.
  - The perturbation is caught only by a delete-heavy workload, whose free list crosses a sector boundary. That is why `run.sh` has a heavy torn tier.
- **The crash harness gained flush sampling**, in the tree (`gsql_io_sim_flush_points`). Sampled uniformly, a run of thousands of operations rarely lands on the one flush that makes a meta page durable. Half the crash points are now drawn from flushes.
  - Measured on 2.A: unsynced commits kept by a crash rose from 150 to 636 in the same run, so far more of the oracle's range is exercised.
  - The single-slot perturbation went from 1 violation to 5.

- **2.B's checkpoint copies only durable frames**, and none past the oldest open reader. Copying a frame of a commit that is not yet durable puts a page into the main file that a crash can leave without its log; that perturbation was caught at 588 violations in 9,153 crashes.
  - The log is reset (a new salt and epoch, then truncated) only when every frame is in the main file. The reset's own test that no reader needs the log is implied by the checkpoint's limit, so a perturbation removing it is legitimately green; it stays as a guard.
- **2.B's creation writes the header last.** The state page and the catalog are written and flushed, and only then the header. The other way round, a power loss kept the header and lost what followed, and recovery found a database it could not read. The crash harness found this twice: first a missing state page, then, once that was checked, a missing catalog. The fix is the write order, not more checks.
- **A commit in 2.B answers IO if the checkpoint after it fails a flush**, even though the commit itself is durable. Answering OK hid that the store had become unusable, and the harness found it. IO is the honest answer, and it is safe, since a commit reported as failed may be either kept or lost.
- **2.B keeps commits that had not returned durable far more often than 2.A**: in 12,893 of 18,672 power-loss crashes in the first run, against a few hundred for 2.A. Its log frames can land and stay valid without a flush, while 2.A recovers only what a meta page names.
- **The crash harness gained a continuation stage** (§5.3: "a further workload runs, crashes and recovers correctly"). After recovery it runs a continuation of mixed synced and unsynced commits, crashes it at a seeded point, and judges the result against the recovered state plus a prefix of the continuation.
  - The single durable commit it had before could not see an engine that accepts **stale log frames**: the frames a lost commit leaves behind, partly overwritten later. Removing 2.B's checksum chain passed 44,000 crashes. With the continuation it is caught (4 power and 1 torn violations in 45,000 crashes, and 5 and 9 in 350,000 at rare checkpoints), with the correct engines clean.
  - It is a rare case, because each log reset changes the salt and invalidates stale frames anyway.

- **2.C must flush the directory before renaming a manifest into place, as well as after.** A compaction creates new sorted files, then renames a manifest naming them. Pending namespace operations survive power loss as any subsequence, so the rename could survive while the creations did not, and recovery found a manifest naming files that were not there. The crash harness found it, as both a recovery failure and a continuation coming back as no prefix. It costs one extra directory flush per manifest write. A journalling filesystem would usually preserve the order, but rule 2 does not promise it.
- **2.C's readers pin the version they began with**: the files and the memtable. A flush makes a new version with an empty memtable, so an older reader keeps the old memtable and the old files, which between them hold the same data.
  - The first draft cleared the memtable in place, freeing nodes an open reader was pointing at.
  - Because of the pinning, compaction's "keep every version a snapshot needs" rule is not load-bearing. Perturbing it, and reclaiming retired trees under open snapshots, both pass every test. It would matter if readers used the current version filtered by sequence, as LevelDB's snapshots do. The cost of pinning is space while a reader is held (W6), the same shape as 2.A's pinned pages.
- **A flush in 2.C makes unsynced commits durable**, since their data is now in a flushed file. So a fresh snapshot may see more than the last synced commit. The functional test's model accepts the durable or the committed state, and treats the latter as now durable.
- **2.C does not meet G5 yet.** A write transaction's buffer is held in memory. Bounding it needs an ingest path that turns spilled runs into level-0 files at commit.
- **2.C has no block cache yet**, so every block read goes to disk: the functional test reads about 33,000 blocks against 2.A's 2,800 pages. That must be fixed before performance is measured, or 2.C loses for a reason that is not its design.
- **2.C needs several files**: a manifest, logs, sorted files and a lock file. That is not "one file plus at most a log" (§7 question 6). Folding them into one needs an extent allocator the other two do not have.
- **2.C takes the full 1,024-byte key at any block size.** It has no page-fill constraint, where 2.A and 2.B cap at 984 bytes at 4 KiB.

| 2.C: replay ignores record checksums | torn only (1): the records' own lengths reject most tears |
| 2.C: recovery leaves the log tail in place | **green**: a stale record survives only if a new commit is exactly the size of a lost one |
| 2.C: compaction ignores snapshots; retired trees reclaimed under snapshots | **green, legitimately**: readers pin their version (above) |
